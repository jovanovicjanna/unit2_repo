## How many different colors could you represent in a 6 bit computer? 

To calculate how many different colors can be captured or displayed, simply raise the number 2 to the power of the number of bits used to record or display the image. In this case it would be 2^6 = 64
 
In a 6 bit computer we can represent 64 colors.
